# Bioinformatics Problems

A couple of bioinformatic problems that i solved during some courses that i took. I hope this can be useful.
Some libraries such as Biopython can be way easier to tackle these problems. Whatsoever the understanding of the logic behind each problem it's really important to improve knowledge and programming abilities.
