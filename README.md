# Bioinformatics Problems

A couple of bioinformatic problems that i solved during some courses that i took. I hope this can be useful.
Some libraries such as Biopython could help to tackle these problems. Whatsoever, the understanding of the logic behind each problem certainly improved my knowledge and programming abilities.
